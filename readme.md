This is a repository containing solutions to the Try It Yourself exercises related to the Alien Invasion game in Python Crash Course, 2nd edition. Each solution is an entire game, so it's a little easier to work with these solutions in a separate repository.

The online resources for the second edition of Python Crash Course are here: [https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/regular_index/](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/regular_index/)
